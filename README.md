# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the dataset. There are certain Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review. 


## Results

* There were 10,080 Vine reviews and 4,839,483 non-Vine reviews.
* 4481 Vine reviews were 5 stars and 3,035,639 non-Vine reviews were 5 stars.
* Of the 5 star reviews, 0.15% were Vine reviews, and 99.85% were non-Vine reviews


## Summary
There is not a positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Because there is such a large number of reviews, the reviews from the Vine program did not skew the data. In addition to this analysis, we could compare 4 star Vine reviews and 4 star non-Vine reviews to see if Vine reviews are on average similar to non-Vine reviews. It would be helpful to use a data-set where the Vine reviews are a greater % of all reviews.
